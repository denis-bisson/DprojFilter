The files in this directly are simply for test purpose.
Let's store in some list of files, job for --GroupOptions, etc.

File extension conventions:
===========================
  .dproj = basic file on which we apply our acctions
    .lst = list of files
 .joblst = files to feed --GroupOptions

 File extensions names are not mandatory.
 It simply help us, poor humans, to remember what does what.

 OriginalDprojs.zip:
 ===================
 That file is there because after many tests, we expect the ending .dprojs will be full of tests, it could be good to have something to refresh them.
